# LudumDare28

Ludum Dare is a game jam where participants are tasked with making a game over a weekend.

[2 Legs, 2 Many](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=29417) is my entry. It's a QWOP-inspired platformer where you control an awkward one-legged chap who needs to swivel and hop his way to a goal in a succession of levels.
